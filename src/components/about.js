        <p>
        i’m currently a software developer at <a href={"https://www.bitgo.com/"}>BitGo</a> in Palo Alto and a recent grad from <a href={"https://northeastern.edu"}>Northeastern University</a>. </p>

<p>thanks to my professional experience and my Bachelor of Science in C.S., I’ve developed a knack for creating robust, user-friendly products and seeing them through the entire product development life cycle.</p>

<p>when I'm not busy coding, you’ll find me experimenting with analog photography, skiing my way down snow-covered slopes, or lost in the pages of a good novel.
